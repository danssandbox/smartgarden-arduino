This basic example tests out reading from the ultrasonic sensor

Base kit is: https://store.arduino.cc/usa/ioterrific-bundle
ultrasonic sensor: http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Ultrasonic_Ranger/
Details about the MKR Connector : https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/MKRConnectorCarrier

Key notes:
- Use the D ports on the connector (they are the digital connections)
- Don't use D6, it is meant to be combined with D5
